# Simulation of the Valley Filling EV Charging Algorithm

## Overview
This project simulates the Valley Filling Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Algorithm. The algorithm aims to optimize the charging schedule of EVs to minimize the impact on the power grid by filling the valleys in the demand curve.

## Features
- Simulation of EV charging schedules
- Optimization of power grid load
- Visualization of demand curves

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoyobuzz/Simulation-of-the-Valley-Filling-EV-Charging-Algorithm
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Simulation-of-the-Valley-Filling-EV-Charging-Algorithm
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. View the results:
   - The simulation results will be saved in the `outputs` directory.
   - Open the generated plots to visualize the load demand curves.
